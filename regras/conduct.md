<mark style="color:yellow;">**Impartiality and Neutrality:**</mark>** Administrators must be impartial in all server-related decisions, regardless of friendship or affiliation with players or clans.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Transparency in Decisions:**</mark>** Every punishment applied **<mark style="color:red;">**(WARNINGS, KICKS, RBAN, BAN, TBAN)**</mark>** must be logged in a system or spreadsheet accessible to all administrators, detailing the reason and duration of the penalty. Repeated offenders should receive harsher penalties depending on the severity and frequency of infractions.**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Admin Conduct:**</mark>** Administrators should maintain exemplary behavior in-game and on related platforms like Discord and social media. Abuse of power, whether towards players or other administrators, will result in temporary suspension or permanent removal from the admin team.**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Permanent Bans:**</mark>** Permanent bans should only be applied in extreme cases, such as confirmed hacking, extremely toxic behavior, or repeated serious violations. Before applying a permanent ban, players should have the opportunity to APPEAL.**

**Use of External Tools: Admins may use external tools for player monitoring (e.g., server logs and plugins) to detect misconduct, provided this is done ethically and respects players' privacy.**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Admin Training:**</mark>** New administrators must undergo training with experienced admins to ensure they understand all server rules and procedures before performing their duties.**
